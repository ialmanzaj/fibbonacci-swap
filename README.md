# Decentralized P2P powered by Chainlink and Belvo

ZKP2P is a trustles fiat-to-crypto onramp/offramp powered by Chainlink and fintech APIs. 

## Overview 
The network is powered by Chainlink and Belvo, respectively, for areas (1) and (2) due to Chainlinkâ€™s system as a settlement layer and Belvo APIs allowing users to consume bank transaction data to prove of payment.

V0 (PoC) is live on Optimism and Goerli, try it out at zkp2p.xyz. See the repo and demo for usage tips.

After the launch of V2, we will continue experimenting with new infrastructure to improve the UX by bringing down proving times and integrating other payment rails such as Paypal and Transferwise.
